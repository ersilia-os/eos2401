    "Title": "Scaffold Decoration",
    "Description": "The context discusses a novel notation system called Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) that improves upon traditional molecular string representations like SMILES. SAFE reframes SMILES strings as an unordered sequence of interconnected fragment blocks while maintaining compatibility with existing SMILES parsers.",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",
    "Task": ["Generative"],
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Compound"],
    "Output Type": ["String"],
    "Output Shape": "List",
    "Interpretation": "Model generates new molecules from input molecule by replacing the side chains of input molecule.",
